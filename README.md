# Journalista
Journalista is a handy program for keeping journals, diary entries, or other text notes. 

Some of the program features are:
- Creates new entries using the creation timestamp as a filename
- It can filter by entries created during a selected month or otherwise display all files
- Encrypts/Decrypts the loaded files for added privacy (make sure you do not forget your password though)
- Ability to save files to favorites, just like bookmarks in a browser
- Can convert from UTF-8 formats to ANSI
- The program theme can be easily customized
- Can be used as a general purpose text editor, with the standard features
- The location of the entries folder can be freely selected by the user
- PRO TIP: Works great if you select the entries folder inside your dropbox folder
