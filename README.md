-	Encryption on demand of the loaded files for added privacy (make sure you do not forget your password!)
-	Possibility of saving files to favorites, just like bookmarks in a browser
-	Convertion from UTF-8 formats to ANSI
-	The color theme can be customized
-	Can be used as a general purpose text editor, with the standard features

	PRO TIP: Works great if you select the entries folder inside your dropbox folder
